                <p>
                    Hey there traveller. We know you want to see the world. We
                    can see the fire in your eyes when you think about all the
                    waters you haven't sailed, the views you haven't seen and
                    all the authentic Italian Gelato you haven't had a chance to
                    indulge in. You've spent months daydreaming about your
                    travels and envisioning all the experiences you could have.
                    Guess what? Travelling the world is well within your grasp.
                    Here at Contiki, we believe that life’s greatest lessons are
                    learned through travel. That real life doesn’t happen when
                    you colour inside the lines. It’s only when you break free,
                    trust your impulse, and intentionally live with your eyes
                    wide open, that you become the person you’re meant to be.
                    That’s why our tailor-made packages that span over 8 diverse
                    travel styles make us the best people to kick off your round
                    the world tour. With 300 trips spanning 6 continents, you
                    could see yourself being immersed in the sensory delights of
                    the Moroccan Soukhs, following the Inca trail as you hike up
                    Machu Picchu or partying underneath the glistening lights of
                    the Eiffel tower. Want to see it all? You can easily connect
                    our trips to form an epic round the world adventure. No
                    matter if it’s backpacking, camping or sailing, the world is
                    truly your oyster with Contiki. But don’t just take our word
                    for it, check out our trip testimonials if you don’t believe
                    us…
